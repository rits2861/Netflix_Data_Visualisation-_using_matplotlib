# Netflix_Data_Visualisation-_using_matplotlib

Analyzed and visualized 8,800+ titles from Netflix using the public dataset to identify key trends in content production and platform growth.

Built over 10+ custom visualizations (bar, line, pie, stacked plots) using Matplotlib to compare genres, countries, content type, release years, and durations.

Cleaned and pre-processed raw CSV data (e.g., date parsing, missing value handling) using Pandas for accurate plotting and insights.
